The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 288 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed of 1 second, determined by SysTick Timer
   working in interrupt mode

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Blinky @ 0x0000:	Blinky code that is run from flash address 0x0000
  Blinky @ 0x2000:	Blinky code that is run from flash address 0x2000

This sample is intended as a demonstration for NXP's secondary USB bootloader.

This blinky project will verify that the flash contents of the Dummy array.

Note: A full sized 512kb binary image has also been included to test the
entire flash contents when programmed using the secondary bootloader.
The filename of this binary: "full_512kb_blinky.bin"
