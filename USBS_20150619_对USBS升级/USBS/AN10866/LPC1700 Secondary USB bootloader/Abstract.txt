LPC1700 USB Bootloader
==================================================================
Changes in this version:
IAP clock parameter is change to SystemFrequency/1000. This is required to
ensure correct flash program and erase time

==================================================================
Hardware configuration/requirements:
-	Ensure that the jumpers for the USB's D+ and D- set to "DEVICE".
-	A USB cable "Type B" to power the board and to access the USB bootloader.

The secondary USB bootloader will check for:
	1.	CRP3 code write protection
	2.	Existing user code already programmed in flash (default address 0x2000)
	3.	a "LOW" voltage level on the Entry pin (default P1.20)

If user code is present and CRP 3 is enabled the USB bootloader will
automatically execute the user code.

If user code is present and CRP 3 is not enabled and the entry pin is:
	FALSE (HIGH) it will also automatically execute the user code.
	TRUE  (LOW) it will enter the USB bootloader.

The default user code entry point:	FLASH sector 2 (0x2000)
The default entry pin:	P1.20 requireing a LOW voltage level

Once the bootloader has been loaded:
	Open the new MSC drive showing in "My Computer" (Windows workstation)
	Delete the default "firmware.bin"
	Copy the new binary (.bin) of the user code onto the drive
		(See the sample RTCCAL project abstract)
	Change the entry pin voltage level to HIGH
	Reset the LPC1700
